# Laser-D design

## Mandatory BetterC mode

Laser-D always compiles D source in BetterC mode. The compiler parameter
defaults disable ModuleInfo, TypeInfo, exception handling, and garbage
collector-dependent features. After configuration files and command-line
arguments are parsed, the driver reapplies the complete BetterC parameter set
so user input cannot disable or partially override it.

The `-betterC` option remains accepted for source-build compatibility with D
tooling, but it is redundant in Laser-D.

BetterC also enables the frontend's `allInst` parameter. Laser-D retains this
behavior so template instances needed by a root module are emitted into its
object files instead of relying on another object file or the D runtime to
provide them. This maximizes linkability for standalone programs and libraries
that have only the C runtime available. `allInst` does not impose the BetterC
language restrictions itself; it is a complementary template code-generation
setting used by upstream DMD whenever `-betterC` is selected.

Regression tests for this behavior live in `compiler/test/laser-d` rather than
the upstream D test categories, because the upstream suite assumes full D
language and runtime support.
